# Model-Inversion-Attack

This a TensorFlow Implementation of the Model Inversion Attack introduced with [Model Inversion Attacks that Exploit Confidence Information and Basic Countermeasures](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2813677) (Fredrikson Et al.)

The gradient step and the final output of the attack loop is pre-processed with ZCA whitening and Global Contrast Normalization with Pylearn2, this helps to preserve the facial features present in the input dataset. 


The important dependencies of this project include: 
- TensorFlow 
- Pylearn2
- Matplotlib
